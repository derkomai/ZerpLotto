                    <h2>What is ZerpLotto?</h2>
                    <p>ZerpLotto is an open-source lottery game that distributes XRP prizes. <a href="https://ripple.com/xrp/">XRP</a> is the digital asset native to the XRP Ledger, 
                        a decentralized cryptographic ledger (commonly called Blockchain).</p>
                    <p>ZerpLotto constantly monitorizes a XRP account and all the transactions sent to it. When you send XRP to this account,
                        you are anonymously buying your participation to the lottery. Once several people have sent enough XRP in order to fullfill the prize,
                        ZerpLotto will automatically select a winner among the participants and send him/her the prize. Your chances to win are proportional
                        to your participation amount. At the same time, <strong>a small percentage of the prize will be donated to a charity</strong>.</p>

                    <p>You can check the last distributed prizes on the <i>Last Prizes</i> section or on <a href="https://twitter.com/zerplotto">Twitter</a>.
                       Also, if you want to know how ZerpLotto works, you can take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/derkomai/ZerpLotto">source code</a>.</p>

                    <p><i>Note: for security reasons, this website is hosted in a machine completely disconnected from the lottery software.</i></p>

                    </br>

                    <h2>Prizes</h2>
                    <p>Currently, only 100 XRP prizes are being issued. After some prizes are distributed, we will add 1000 XRP or even bigger prizes to ZerpLotto.
                        Also, in the future we intend to prepare some special-occasion prizes like a Christmas prize.</p> 
                    </br>
                    
                    <h2>How do I play and what are the rules?</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>To play, just send your XRP participation deposit to the address shown below. The deposit will be processed, 
                                the fees subtracted and, if you are the winner when the prize is distributed, it will be sent to your address.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Your chances to win are proportional to your deposit amount, i.e., if you deposit 2 XRP for the 100 XRP prize, you have a 2% chance of winning.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>You can select which prize are you participating in by specifying a destination tag when making your deposit. The destination tag <i>100</i> 
                                means you want to participate in the 100 XRP prize (check the available prizes above). If you don't provide a destination tag, the highest value available prize will be selected for you.
                                Please carefully set your destination tag (or do not set it at all) as some tags are reserved and may result in your deposit not being processed.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>It's important that you <strong>send your deposits from an actual XRP account under your control, not from an exchange or similar service</strong>.
                                Exchanges usually rotate addresses and/or require destination tags to identify their clients, so sending from them may result in
                                the prize not reaching your account and you having to deal with the exchange support team. You can create a software wallet using
                                <a href="https://toastwallet.com/">Toast Wallet!</a> or buy a hardware wallet like <a href="https://www.ledger.com/">Ledger wallet</a>
                                in order to participate.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>To keep things fun, there is a max participation per deposit equals to the 5% of the prize value. If you surpase this threshold, the exceeding amount will be returned.
                                You can send as many deposits as you like, but please bear in mind this is a game created for fun purposes only. Play responsibly.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Prizes are automatically distributed when the prize value is fullfilled with participations. Once a prize is distributed, another prize is started.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Every prize, fee, assotiated donation and participating transactions can be checked on <a href="https://twitter.com/zerplotto">Twitter</a>.</p>
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    </ul>
                    </br>

                    <h2>Fees and charity</h2>
                    <p>For every participating deposit, a 1% platform fee and a 4% charity fee will be subtracted. The charity fee will then be automatically sent to a charity randomly selected from the supported list.
                    The remaining 95% will be processed as the actual participation.
                    </p>
                    <p>For a charity to be supported in ZerpLotto, it is required that they support XRP donations. Currently, the only supported charity is <a href="https://www.unicef.fr/">Unicef France</a>.</p>
                    <p>If you know more charities accepting XRP donations, please let us know on <a href="https://twitter.com/zerplotto">Twitter</a>.</p>
